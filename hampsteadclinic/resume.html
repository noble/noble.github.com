<h1 class="ital">Nicholas Mikniche</h1>

<p>I was born in Croatia, but spent my formative years in Sydney, Australia,
where I graduated as a Dental Surgeon from the highly respected Sydney University,
Australia's oldest university.</p>

<p>In the last twenty years I have owned and run 4 dental clinics and practises.
These have ranged from a social dental clinic providing care for all sectors
or the community to very specialised private practice clinics.</p>

<p>Prior to entering the dental faculty I took the opportunity to observe
life through the study of Hotel Management but then chose Dentistry as I felt
it better fulfilled my need to enter a profession which would satisfy my
intellect as well as my desire to assist humanity.</p>
</div><!-- end page 1-->
<div id="page2" class="hidden" style="height:345px;"><!-- page 2-->
<p>As my interest lies in people, I look towards treating the complete person and not
just mechanically repairing their separate parts i.e. teeth, soft tissue, jaws, joints and
surrounding muscles, and poor oral appearance with the resulting detrimental psychological
and social affects that this causes.</p>

<p>As a result of total approach towards treating an individual, I call this a 'holistic'
approach to dentistry, and over the years I have developed and refined my expertise
 in order to fulfil my objectives.</p>
<h2>Seminars & post-graduate programs</h2>
<p>I have undertaken and been involved in numerous seminars, clinics, and post-graduate specialising programs in the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="grey">Tempero-mandibular joint disorders (which can cause headache and migraine) and their management.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="page3" class="hidden" style="height:345px;"><!-- page 3-->
<ul>
<li><span class="grey">Toxicology of materials and their removal and management of such substances from the mouth, especially for extremely sensitive individuals. (i.e. Multiple Sclerosis and other auto-immune diseases.)</span></li>

<li><span class="grey">The use of relative anaesthesia and intravenous sedation techniques. (SAAD)</span></li>




<li><span class="grey">Hypnosis and other psychological techniques in patient management.</span></li>
<li><span class="grey">Cosmetic and state of the art techniques to produce the ultimate beautiful smile, utilising the ever-changing materials and modern porcelain bonding techniques.</span></li>
<li><span class="grey">Bleaching, both internally and externally to enhance the appearance of natural teeth.</span></li>

<li><span class="grey">Modern ceramic technology and techniques and their application in complete and full mouth reconstruction and rehabilitation.</span></li>
<li><span class="grey">Soft tissue management and periodontically compromised dentition and their management i.e. soft tissue surgery and splinting techniques.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="page4" class="hidden" style="height:345px;"><!-- page 4-->
<ul>

<li><span class="grey">Control of periapical infection through use of root canal treatment including the latest 'step down' technique as developed by Professor Buchanon.</span></li>
<li><span class="grey">Implants and their placement where there are no teeth and fixed or removable appliances require fixed and stable anchorage. I use the 'Bicon System' from Boston Massachusetts, USA. This system has the advantage over the others by the fact that it has no screws, which tend to loosen over time. Bicon uses a tapering lock method for simplicity, stability and strength</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Dentistry is both a science and an art. It is evolving very rapidly and as a result a true professional, who cares about his patients, must keep abreast of these changes and always be anticipating the next step forward.</p>
